# IC Studios

IC Studios is a small, independent team focused on building games, tools, and weird experiments.  
We’re not a big studio, we’re not corporate, and we’re definitely not chasing trends.  
We make the kind of stuff we *want* to play – projects that feel raw, experimental, and personal.

## 🎮 What We Do

- **Games** – Mostly PC-based, sometimes dipping into VR. We like retro shooters, surreal worlds, and sandbox environments.  
- **Experiments** – Half-finished ideas, operating systems, interactive art, prototypes that may or may not grow into full projects.  
- **Sound & Atmosphere** – Music and soundtracks are just as important to us as the visuals. Expect moody tracks, unsettling ambience, and a few surprises.  
- **Community Mods** – We want our games to be moddable and open. If you can break it, hack it, or twist it, you’re already one of us.

## 🌌 Our Style

We tend to lean into:
- **Retro inspirations** – Quake, Doom, Half-Life, and early 2000s weird PC stuff.  
- **Liminal vibes** – Empty malls, endless hallways, uncanny backrooms.  
- **Experimental mechanics** – Things that make you stop and go “wait, what was *that*?”  
- **DIY energy** – We don’t care if it’s perfect, we care if it’s interesting.  

We’re not afraid to release something a little broken if it’s fun or thought-provoking.

## 🔮 Why We Do This

Because it’s fun. Because games don’t have to be polished products. Because some of the best memories we have come from booting up weird indie projects, unfinished mods, or strange little worlds made by a handful of people in their bedrooms.  

That’s the kind of spirit we want to keep alive with IC Studios.
